Got my Dipl. Ing. in the Department of Computer Engineering and Informatics in Patras, Greece. Continued studying in ETH Zurich and got my MSc in Computer Science, focusing in Distributed Systems, Web & System Security.

Currently at [*Red Hat*](https://redhat.com/), working as a Software Engineer on [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift). Previously worked in [Futurae](https://futurae.com) and [u-blox](https://www.u-blox.com/).

Interested in the fields of Web Services, Software-as-a-Service architectures, Distributed Systems, Web/Network/System Security and System and Cloud Architecture. Curious by nature about how things work and why, passionate about building software systems on the web. When not engineering things, I'm into socialising, music, books and sports.
